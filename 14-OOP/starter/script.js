// Behind the scenes this code generated 4 steps as we called the new operator:
//* Read {} as Object

// 1. New Object {} is created right away
// 2. function is called, this keyword now is equal to the new empty object (this = {})
// 3. {} is linked to prototype
// 4. {} is automatically returns from the function

// Since object.prototype is the top of the prototype chain, this is null:
console.log(paolo.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__);

console.log('');
console.log(Person.prototype.constructor); // This returns the function.
console.dir(Person.prototype.constructor); // Now we can inspect the function.

console.log('--- Array Prototype ---');
const arr = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(arr.__proto__); // So we can see that all of the methods we studied (pop, push, fill, sort, splice...) are available because
// each array inherits these methods from it's prototype.

console.log(arr.__proto__ === Array.prototype); //* The prototype property of the constructor (Array.prototype) is gonna be the prototype
//* off al the objects created by that constructor (arr.__proto__)
//* Whenever we use [] to create an array, behind the scenes JS will grant access to all Array prototypes to the new object array.

console.log(arr.__proto__.__proto__); // Now we are back to having object.prototype, this one has hasOwnProperty and all the other methods
// available for objects while arr.__proto__ does not have. And this is simply because the prototype itself (arr.__proto__) is an object.
// And any object has access to all of these methods.

//* So the prototype is a mechanism of reuse code. So all the methods of an array has to exist in only one place in JS.

//* Using that knowledge we can extend the arrays methods ADDING A NEW METHOD for example:
Array.prototype.unique = function () {
  return [...new Set(this)]; // new Set will return all unique values, with argument 'this' we set the array, then we spread it with ... and
  // encapsulate everything in a array with []
};
// Now we can use it in all the arrays...
console.log(arr.unique());

//! It is NOT a good idea to add methods to native functions for many reasons. The next version of JS can include a method with the same
//! name and a different functionality, the code will use the new method and probably break the code.
//! Another reason is if the project involves more a team of programers if two uses the same name it will create so many bugs...

const h1 = document.querySelector('h1');
console.dir(h1); // as we can see the Prototype in the end of the object is a HTMLHeadingElement and if we expand it we get another prototype
// with HTMLElement that we studied in the beginning of the DOM section.
//* As we inspect it we can see 6 levels of chain prototypes

// Any function is also an object and therefore it also has prototype.
console.dir(x => x + 1); // This anonymous function contains apply, bind and call...That's why we can call these functions on it...

  _approveLoan(val) {
    // since we inserted the _ before the name of this method, it should not be public outside the API, all the others should be.
    return true; // no need to implement a complex logic here, just to show the funcitonality.

  requestLoan(val) {

const acc1 = new Account('Paolo', 'EUR', 1111);
console.log(acc1);

// Adding an movement, we could directly write like this, however it is not a good idea, let's create a method for that.
// acc1.movements.push(250);
// acc1.movements.push(-140);

// With the methods:
acc1.deposit(250);
acc1.withdraw(140);
acc1.requestLoan(1000);
// if we had a logic in approveLoan in this scenario we could simply do: accc1.approveLoan = true, but in the real world we couldn't
// have access to approveLoan. This is why we need some data encapsulation and data privacy.

// This would be a right way of getting the movements.
console.log(acc1.getMovements());

console.log(acc1);

// So deposit and withdraw are a public interface, or an interface to our objects, also called API.
// Using the API we abstracted away the fact that the user must input a negative value to a withdraw, that only can avoid bugs.
console.log(acc1.pin); // so the pin is accessible outside from outside of the class.
