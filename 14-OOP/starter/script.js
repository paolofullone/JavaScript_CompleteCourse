//? 203 Constructor Functions and the new Operator.mp4

// In OOP there's a convention that Constructor Functions always starts with a capital letter. Arrow function doest not work with
// Constructor Functions because it does not have the this keyword. Only function declarations and function expressions works.
const Person = function (firstName, birthYear) {
  //   console.log(this);
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.birthYear = birthYear;

  // Never create a method inside a constructor function like this one:
  //   this.calcAge = function () {
  //     console.log(2021 - this.birthYear);
  //   };
  //* If we had a 1000 objects we would create a 1000 copies of the function...
  //* To solve it we use prototype and prototype inheritance.
};

const paolo = new Person('Paolo', 1978);
console.log(paolo);

// Behind the scenes this code generated 4 steps as we called the new operator:
//* Read {} as Object

// 1. New Object {} is created right away
// 2. function is called, this keyword now is equal to the new empty object (this = {})
// 3. {} is linked to prototype
// 4. {} is automatically returns from the function

// Blueprint analogy...
const kely = new Person('Kely', 1978);
const luca = new Person('Luca', 2011);
const manu = new Person('Manuela', 2012);

console.log(kely, luca, manu);

// To check if a object is from a class:
console.log('--- Check object ---');
const john = 'John';

// paolo is an instance of Person
console.log(paolo instanceof Person);
console.log(john instanceof Person);

//? 210
Person.hey = function () {
  console.log('Hey there ðŸ‘‹');
  console.log(this); // the this keyword is the entire constructor function here, that is exactly the object (Person) that is calling the
  // method.
};

// Person.hey();
// paolo.hey(); // as we cannot call a from method directly on an array, we cannot call paolo.hey() because the .hey() is not in the
// prototype of the paolo object.

//? 204 Prototypes.mp4

//* Each and every function in JS automatically has a property called prototype. Including of course the constructor
//* functions. Every object created by a certain constructor function get access to all the methods and properties
//* that we define on the constructors prototype property.
console.log(Person.prototype);

Person.prototype.calcAge = function () {
  console.log(2021 - this.birthYear);
};

// Now I can call the calcAge method even though the paolo object does not contain the calcAge method. We can call it because of inheritance.
paolo.calcAge();

// This solves the problem of attaching the method directly to the Constructor Function. This way exists only one copy of the function.

//* Any object always has access to the methods and properties from its prototype.
console.log('--- Each object has a special property "proto" ---');
console.log(paolo.__proto__);
console.log(paolo.__proto__ === Person.prototype);
console.log(
  '\nThis confirms that Person.prototype is indeed the prototype of Jonas.'
);
console.log(Person.prototype.isPrototypeOf(paolo));

console.log('\nBut Person.prototype is not the prototype of Person.');
console.log(Person.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Person));

//* So basically the .prototype should be called something like .prototypeOfLinkedObjects or something like this.

//* The __proto__ property is created in step 3 of a Constructor Property.

// Setting properties on prototype.

Person.prototype.species = 'Homo Sapiens';
console.log(paolo, kely);
console.log(
  'So, firstName is a Own Property and Species is a property that the paolo object has access to because of the prototype.'
);
console.log(paolo.hasOwnProperty('firstName'));
console.log(paolo.hasOwnProperty('species'));

//? 205 Prototypal Inheritance and The Prototype Chain.mp4
/*
// PROTOTYPE CHAIN is very similar to SCOPE CHAIN.

//? 206 Prototypal Inheritance on Built-In Objects.mp4

console.log('--- Prototypes ---');
console.log(paolo.__proto__);
// Object.prototype is the top of the prototype chain.
console.log(paolo.__proto__.__proto__); // this is the prototype property of object. We can see that the constructor is the object.
// and we also can see that the object has the hasOwnProperty()
// Since object.prototype is the top of the prototype chain, this is null:
console.log(paolo.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__);

console.log('');
console.log(Person.prototype.constructor); // This returns the function.
console.dir(Person.prototype.constructor); // Now we can inspect the function.

console.log('--- Array Prototype ---');
const arr = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(arr.__proto__); // So we can see that all of the methods we studied (pop, push, fill, sort, splice...) are available because
// each array inherits these methods from it's prototype.

console.log(arr.__proto__ === Array.prototype); //* The prototype property of the constructor (Array.prototype) is gonna be the prototype
//* off al the objects created by that constructor (arr.__proto__)
//* Whenever we use [] to create an array, behind the scenes JS will grant access to all Array prototypes to the new object array.

console.log(arr.__proto__.__proto__); // Now we are back to having object.prototype, this one has hasOwnProperty and all the other methods
// available for objects while arr.__proto__ does not have. And this is simply because the prototype itself (arr.__proto__) is an object.
// And any object has access to all of these methods.

//* So the prototype is a mechanism of reuse code. So all the methods of an array has to exist in only one place in JS.

//* Using that knowledge we can extend the arrays methods ADDING A NEW METHOD for example:
Array.prototype.unique = function () {
  return [...new Set(this)]; // new Set will return all unique values, with argument 'this' we set the array, then we spread it with ... and
  // encapsulate everything in a array with []
};
// Now we can use it in all the arrays...
console.log(arr.unique());

//! It is NOT a good idea to add methods to native functions for many reasons. The next version of JS can include a method with the same
//! name and a different functionality, the code will use the new method and probably break the code.
//! Another reason is if the project involves more a team of programers if two uses the same name it will create so many bugs...

const h1 = document.querySelector('h1');
console.dir(h1); // as we can see the Prototype in the end of the object is a HTMLHeadingElement and if we expand it we get another prototype
// with HTMLElement that we studied in the beginning of the DOM section.
//* As we inspect it we can see 6 levels of chain prototypes

// Any function is also an object and therefore it also has prototype.
console.dir(x => x + 1); // This anonymous function contains apply, bind and call...That's why we can call these functions on it...

//* 1. Classes are NOT hoisted (we cannot use them before they are declared in the code.)
//* 2. Classes are also first-class citizens, we can pass them into functions and also return them from functions. That is because classes

//* 3. Classes are executed on strict mode. Even if we didn't activate it, the classes are executed in strict mode.
