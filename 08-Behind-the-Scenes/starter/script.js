const kely = me;
kely.age = 40;
console.log('Kely', kely);
console.log('Me', me); // here we get the same age for both

// in the 099 Primitives vs. Objects (Primitive vs. Reference Types).png we can see that the primitives
// are stored in the call stack, while the reference types are stored in the heap

// 099 Primitives vs. Objects (Primitive vs. Reference Types)2.png
// Regarding primitive values on call stack:
// When we first set the age to 30, it stores that information in a so called 0001 memory address.
// oldAge is equal to age, so it has the same 0001 memory address.
// when we change the age to 31, a new memory address (0002) will be allocated with the new value.

// Reference values:
// So again, when we declare a variable as an object, an identifier is created,
// which points to a piece of memory in the stack, which in turn points to a piece of memory in the heap.
// And that is where the object is actually stored. And it works this way because objects might be
// too large to be stored in the stack. Instead they are stored in the heap, which is like an almost unlimited memory pool.
// And the stack just keeps a reference to where the object is actually stored in the heap
// so that it can find it whenever necessary.
//

// And by the way, even though we defined the Friend variable as a constant, we can actually still manipulate the object
// without problems. And when we think about that, it makes sense because we're actually not changing the value in memory
// for the Friend identifier, it is still D30F. So the reference to the object.
// All we did was to change the value in the heap, and that's not a problem.
// So it's a misconception that all variables declared with const are immutable.
// In fact, that is only true for primitive values, but not for reference values.
// So keep that in mind, whenever you're working with const.

// 099 Primitives vs. Objects (Primitive vs. Reference Types).png
// We can see that a reference value copied to another object has the same address in the HEAP.
// So if we change the value of this Address in HEAP the new value will point to all the objects.
// In this case the variables me and kely.

*/
// 100 Primitives vs. Objects in Practice.mp4

// as seen each primitive value is saved in it's own piece of memory in the stack, that's why we have both names.

// Primitive types:
let lastName = 'Williams';
let oldLastName = lastName;
lastName = 'Davis';
console.log(lastName, oldLastName);

// now let's do the same with an object which is a reference value stored in the heap
// and the stack only keeps a reference to the memory position which the object is stored at the heap.
// reference types:
const jessica = {
  firstName: 'Jessica',
  lastName: 'Williams',
  age: 27,
};

const marriedJessica = jessica; // we are copying the jessica object to marriedJessica,
// however behind the scenes, this one is not a new object in the Heap. it's just another
// variable in the stack that holds the reference to the original object.
// Both marriedJessica and jessica variables point to the same memory address in the heap.
// because in the stack they both hold the same memory reference in the heap.
// This is why we can change the content of the const, which has a value in the stack that
// cannot be changed, in the stack the value only holds the reference to the heap, which we are not actually changing.
// We are changing the underlying object stored in the heap, and that has nothing to do with const or let.
// we cannot try to attempt a complete new object to marriedJessica because that would create a new memory address.

// Conclusion: completely changing an object, assigning a new object to it, is completely different than
// changing a property.

console.log('Before marriage:', jessica2);

// behind the scenes a new object was created in the heap.
// However, we still have a problem, the object.assign only works in the first level
// if we have an object inside the object, then the inner object will actually still be the same
// it will still point to the same place in memory. That's why object.assign creates a shallow copy
// and not a deep clone.

const jessica3 = {
  firstName: 'Jessica',
  lastName: 'Williams',
  age: 27,
  family: ['Alice', 'Bob'], // now we included this array.
};

// The object.assign will merge two objects and create a new one. Here we merged and empty

// now and example of this issue:
const jessicaCopy3 = Object.assign({}, jessica3);
jessicaCopy3.lastName = 'Davis';

jessicaCopy3.family.push('John');
