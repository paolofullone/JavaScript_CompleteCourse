// Coding Challenge #1

/* 
Let's build a simple poll app!

A poll has a question, an array of options from which people can choose, and an array with the number of replies for each option. This data is stored in the starter object below.

Here are your tasks:

1. Create a method called 'registerNewAnswer' on the 'poll' object. The method does 
two things:
  1.1. Display a prompt window for the user to input the number of the selected option. 
  The prompt should look like this:
        What is your favourite programming language?
        0: JavaScript
        1: Python
        2: Rust
        3: C++
        (Write option number)
  
  1.2. Based on the input number, update the answers array. For example, if the option 
  is 3, increase the value AT POSITION 3 of the array by 1. Make sure to check if the 
  input is a number and if the number makes sense (e.g answer 52 wouldn't make sense, 
  right?)
2. Call this method whenever the user clicks the "Answer poll" button.
3. Create a method 'displayResults' which displays the poll results. The method takes a 
string as an input (called 'type'), which can be either 'string' or 'array'. If type is
 'array', simply display the results array as it is, using console.log(). This should be
 the default option. If type is 'string', display a string like "Poll results are 13, 2, 
 4, 1". 
4. Run the 'displayResults' method at the end of each 'registerNewAnswer' method call.

HINT: Use many of the tools you learned about in this and the last section ðŸ˜‰

BONUS: Use the 'displayResults' method to display the 2 arrays in the test data. 
Use both the 'array' and the 'string' option. Do NOT put the arrays in the poll object!
So what shoud the this keyword look like in this situation?

BONUS TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 3]
BONUS TEST DATA 2: [1, 5, 3, 9, 6, 1]

// 135 Closures.mp4
/*
// almost MYSTICAL feature in JS, brings execution contest, call stack, scope chain
// concepts together in a beautiful and almost magical way!

// A closure is not a feature that we explicity use as a function, array etc. It simply
// happens in some situations, we need to recognize these situations.

const secureBooking = function () {
  let passengerCount = 0;

  return function () {
    passengerCount++;
    console.log(`${passengerCount} passengers`);
  };
};
const passengerCount = 10;
const booker = secureBooking();
booker();
booker();

// So, the passengerCount when we call the function brooker() once, turns to 1,
// despite the other passengerCount declared as const in purpose on the global escope

// Describing as the lecture:
/* Before we start running the secureBooking function down in the code, our code is
running in the Global Execution Context and we only have the secureBooking function.
in the CALL STACK, then we also only have the secureBooking function in the GLOBAL SCOPE.

When secureBooking is executed, a new secureBooling EC is put on top of the Global EC
in the CALL STACK, each EC contains its own variable enviroment which contain all it's local
variables. In this case it only contais passenger count set to zero. So passengerCount
is in the local scope but also gets access to all variables in parents scope, 
in this case just a global scope.

The secureBooking function returns another function that updates the passengerCount variable
and we stored the secureBooking inside the booker variable. So the Global Context also
contais the booker variable.

When the secureBooking function returns it's Execution Context pops off the stack and disappears. 
So the secureBooking function has done its job and now finished the execution. 
IMPORTANT TO BE AWARE AND TO KEEP IN MIND.

How can the booker function update the passengerCount variable defined in the secureBooking function 
that actually has already finished executing? secureBooking already executed and it's gone. But 
the booker function is still able to access the passengerCount variable inside the passengerCount function.
This is possible due the CLOSURE.

So, the booker function "booker()" is a function that exists in the global scope and the enviroment in which 
the function was created no longer exists. But sill the booker function has access to the variables that
were present at the time that the function was created. In this particular case the passengerCount variable.
That's what the closure does.

The closure makes a function remember all the variables that existed at the functions birthplace essentially.
We can imagine the secureBooking as the birthplace of the function that increments the number of passengers.

function () {
    passengerCount++;
    console.log(`${passengerCount} passengers`);
  };

The function remembers everything at its birthplace by the time it was created. This cannot be explained with the
scope chain alone.

Watch from min 8:45
135 - closures 1 - shows call stack and scope chain after the const booker creation and before we call the booker function.
It is important to remember that the secureBooking EC is no longer in the call stack. 

Now, when we run the booker function that is located in the global scope.
As soon as we run it, a new booker EC is created and put on top of the call stack. 
The variable enviroment of this EC is empty because there are no variables declared in the function. 
The scope chain will have a child scope from global scope that contains no variable but contains 
the secureBooking and booker functions. But any function always has access to the variable enviroment
of the Execution Context in which the function was created. In the case of booker, this function was created, 
it was born, in the EC of the secureBooking, which was popped of the stack previously. But the booker function
will get access to the popped EC which contains the passengerCount variable. And this is how the function
will have access to the variable and manipulate it.

Thanks to the CLOSURE a function never looses connection to the variables that were created at the functions birthplace.

The function attempts to increase the passengerCount variable, however the variable is not in the current scope.
And so JS will immediately look in the closure and see if it can find the variable there. This is done BEFORE looing
in the scope chain. If we have a GLOBAL passengerCount variable set to any value, it will first use the one in closure.
So the CLOSURE has priority over the SCOPE CHAIN.

*/
// So if we type:
// console.dir(booker);

// And check the anonymous function at the console we will see a:
// [[Scopes]] that contains the closure coming from secureBooking
// So the Closure is the variable enviroment of the secure booking.

// BTW whenever we see a [[]] it is a property we cannot access from the code.

// 136 More Closure Examples
/*
/// Example 1

// let f;
// const g = function () {
//   const a = 23;
//   f = function () {
//     console.log(a * 2);
//   };
// };

// g();
// f();
// console.dir(f);

// so we defined the f variable in the global scope
// called g function that only sets const a as 23 and disapears from the call stack
// called f function that is inside the g function which has already closed its variable environment
// but it was still able to access the a variable defined in g function environment.

// So the 'a' variable is inside the backpack of the f()

// Now taking to the next level:

let f;
const g = function () {
  const a = 23;
  f = function () {
    console.log(a * 2);
  };
};

const h = function () {
  const b = 777;
  f = function () {
    console.log(b * 2);
  };
};

g();
f();
console.dir(f);

// Re-assigning f function
h();
f();
console.dir(f);

// so we can see that the variable was reassigned, first it had the a value of 23
// and then it had the b value of 777 inspecting the closure in [[Scopes]]

// So it proves that closure never looses connection with the variables that were present
// at its birthplace.

/// Example 2

const boardPassengers = function (n, wait) {
  const perGroup = n / 3;

  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(`We are now boarding all ${n} passengers.`);
    console.log(`There are 3 groups, each with ${perGroup} passengers.`);
  }, (wait = 1000));

  console.log(`Will start boarding in ${wait} seconds.`);
};

// This will print timer in the console after 1 second.
// This is a callback function, literaly called 1 second latter.
// setTimeout(function () {
//   console.log('Timer');
// }, 1000);

// Proofing that the closure has priority over the scope chain.

const perGroup = 8888; // if we comment out the const perGroup inside the boardPassengers it will use this one.
// and w/o the comment it uses the value inside the boardPassengers function.

boardPassengers(180, 3);

// so due the setTimeout function, the callback function:

// setTimeout(function () {
//   console.log(`We are now boarding all ${n} passengers.`);
//   console.log(`There are 3 groups, each with ${perGroup} passengers.`);
// }, (wait = 1000));

// Was completely independently from the boardPassengers function, it was called
// 3 seconds latter. But still was able to use all the variables of the enviroment
// of the boardPassengers. In this case, n and perGroup. One more time a clear sign
// of a closure being created.
